# Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks

This project is based on the paper: [Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593).

The goal of this project isto train generators that learn to transform an image from domain X into an image that looks like it came from domain Y (and vice versa).
